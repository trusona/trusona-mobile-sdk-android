## Prerequisites

### Artifactory username and password

Trusona uses Artifactory to distribute artifacts associated with the Trusona mobile and server SDKs.

When Trusona provisions a developer account, we will create a new user in Artifactory and supply you with a username and password that you will use later on in this guide.


### SDK API Credentials

The Android SDKs require API credentials that are used by the SDK to identify and authenticate requests from your application to the Trusona APIs.

The two credentials required by the SDKs include a `token` and `secret`. Both are confidential strings generated and distributed by Trusona (as shown in the sample below).

```json
{
  "api_token": "eyJ0eXAiOiJKV1QiLCJhbGciOiJIUzUxMiJ9.eyJpc3MiOiJ0cnVhZG1pbi5hcGkudHJ1c29uYS5jb20iLCJzdWIiOiI1YWZmZWE3OC0xZWU1LTQxZGUtYjkzNy05M2QyYzliYTJhY2MiLCJhdWQiOiJhcGkudHJ1c29uYS5jb20iLCJleHAiOjE1MTk4ODU1NDQsImlhdCI6MTQ4ODMyNzk0NCwianRpIjoiZmI2OGNhMTItYmY1OC00MzYzLTk4M2QtODMzOTE2OTQ1YmYyIiwiYXRoIjoiUk9MRV9UUlVTVEVEX1JQX0NMSUVOVCJ9.2FNvjG9yB5DFEcNijk8TryRtKVffiDARRcRIb75Z_Pp85MxW63rhzdLFIN6PtQ1Tzb8lHPPM_4YOe-feeLOzWw",
  "api_secret": "6b946015531bb1939b5536046c42d32c1e788e46843bc2585bc07d4bb938b4c1eb47dff1c508656d88df2c1a5e0b63728c867e7b2c6b8149b52ea67ab35d8c75"
}
```

### Minimum Android Version
The Trusona SDK requires API level 21 or higher. It also requires at least Android Support Library rev. 27.1.1 and Google Play Services rev. 15.0.1.

## Required Configuration


### Adding your credentials to `$HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties`

Gradle supports user specific variables which is a convenient way to handle using sensitive data
in your Gradle scripts without having to check them into your source control system. Create or
open the `$HOME/.gradle/gradle.properties` file under your user's home directory and add the following:

```
trusonaUsername=<YOUR_TRUSONA_ISSUED_MAVEN_USERNAME>
trusonaPassword=<YOUR_TRUSONA_ISSUED_MAVEN_PASSWORD>
```

### Adding the Trusona repository to Gradle

To add the private Trusona repository to your project, edit the `build.gradle` file **at the root folder** and add the following:

```groovy
allprojects {
    repositories {
        maven { url = "https://maven.google.com" }
        mavenCentral()
        mavenLocal()
        jcenter()

        // the trusona repository
        maven {
            credentials {
                username = trusonaUsername
                password = trusonaPassword
            }
            url = "https://trusona.jfrog.io/trusona/sdk-releases/"
        }
    }
}
```


## Installation

The Trusona SDK should be declared as a dependency in your Gradle project.

### Installing as a gradle dependency

> Note: This method requires access to the private Trusona SDK Artifactory repository

1. Ensure that your `~/.gradle.properties` file contains your supplied Artifactory credentials
1. Define the SDK version you wish to use and add the `api` dependency to your Gradle project.

```gradle
dependencies {
  // other dependencies
  api "com.trusona.android:mobile-sdk:6.6.0"

  // the following is only required if you will be using the Trusona Passport SDK
  //api "com.trusona.android:passport-sdk:6.6.0"
}
```

### Java 8 Configuration

The SDK requires Java 8 compatibility. Be sure to have the following configuration within the `android` block of your project's `build.gradle` file:

```gradle
compileOptions {
  sourceCompatibility 1.8
  targetCompatibility 1.8
}
```

### AndroidX Configuration

The SDK has dependencies on the latest [AndroidX](https://developer.android.com/jetpack/androidx) libraries.

For normal function and compatibility with legacy support librabries, add the following configuration to your project's `gradle.properties` file:

```
android.enableJetifier=true
android.useAndroidX=true
```

## Creating a Trusona instance

To create an instance of `Trusona` for making API calls, use the provided constructor to pass the `api token`
and `api secret`.

```java
Trusona trusona = new Trusona(myApiToken, myApiSecret);
```

The Trusona SDKs have infrastructure in place to serve the US, European and Asia-Pacific regions, with the US being the default one. Unless otherwise noted you will not need to configure Trusona to use a specific region. If you have been provisioned in a specific region, you will need to point the SDK to use that region. To achieve this youâ€™ll need to specify one of the possible values from the `Region` enum when building a `Trusona` instance.

```java
// Use this to connect to the European region
Trusona trusona = new Trusona(myApiToken, myApiSecret, Region.EU);     
//or use this to connect to the Asia-Pacific region
Trusona trusona = new Trusona(myApiToken, myApiSecret, Region.AP);
```

### Device Identifier

A device identifier is required to interact with some of the Trusona APIs. To acquire one, simply
make a request to the Trusona API via the `getDeviceIdentifier` method and this will create or update a
device in the Trusona servers. Internally, a set of cryptographic keys will be generated and stored
in the Android Keystore.

> **NOTE** The TrusonaSDK will not work on a device running an API lower than 21.

#### Generated Keys

The Trusona SDK attempts to generate two types of keys:

* **Device Key** - The Device Key is always generated and does not require User Presence. Using this key for signing operations will not prompt the user for any interaction with the device.
* **User Auth Key** - The User Auth Key is generated when the user has a pin, pattern or fingerprint set. Using this key for signing operations (e.g. during a Trusonafication) will prompt the user to enter their pin, pattern or fingerprint.

#### Requesting a Device Identifier

Requesting a device identifier is an asynchronous operation which, once completed, will provide an instance
of `DeviceIdentifierResponse`. This response will contain the device's request status and a device identifier
if one was generated.

The various results of a request to `getDeviceIdentifier` are:

#### Successful results

|        Result           |                                                                       Description                                                                        |  Returns Identifier?  |
| :--------------------   | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------: |
| `NEW_DEVICE`            | Indicates that a new device was successfully created.                                                                                                    |           Yes         |
| `INACTIVE_DEVICE`       | Indicates that the device was already created, but is inactive.                                                                                          |           Yes         |
| `ACTIVE_DEVICE`         | Indicates that the device was already created, and is active.                                                                                            |           Yes         |

#### Failed results

|        Result           |                                                                       Description                                                                        |  Returns Identifier?  |
| :--------------------   | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :-------------------: |
| `INVALID_API_KEYS`      | Indicates that the request to create the device failed because the API token and/or secret used are invalid.                                             |           No          |
| `INVALID_DEVICE`        | Indicates that the request to create the device failed because the server determined the device to be invalid.                                           |           No          |
| `INVALID_RELYING_PARTY` | Indicates that the request to create the device failed because the Relying Party associated with the API Token and Secret is invalid.                    |           No          |
| `SERVER_ERROR`          | Indicates that the request to create the device failed because the server encountered an error.                                                          |           No          |
| `UNKNOWN`               | Indicates that an unknown error occurred.                                                                                                                |           No          |
| `TIMEOUT`               | Indicates that a timeout occurred when hitting the Trusona APIs.                                                                                         |           No          |

#### Example

The following code demonstrates how to acquire a device identifier.

```java
// 1
DeviceIdentifierRequester deviceIdentifierRequester = new DeviceIdentifierRequester() {
    @Override
    public void onDeviceIdentifier(@NonNull DeviceIdentifierResponse deviceIdentifierResponse) {
        switch (deviceIdentifierResponse.getDeviceStatus()) {

            case ACTIVE_DEVICE:
                // A device identifier is available and the device is ready to perform trusonafications.
                break;

            case INACTIVE_DEVICE:
            case NEW_DEVICE:
                // A device identifier is available in these scenarios.
                break;

            case INVALID_API_KEYS:
            case INVALID_DEVICE:
            case INVALID_RELYING_PARTY:
            case SERVER_ERROR:
            case TIMEOUT:
            case UNKNOWN:
                // A device identifier is not available in these scenarios.
                break;
        }
    }
};

//2
trusona.getDeviceIdentifier(context, deviceIdentifierRequester);

```

1. Implement the `DeviceIdentifierRequester` interface that will receive an instance of `DeviceIdentifierResponse`.
The latter will contain the device's status, the `device identifier` and an optional `String` that contains a signed JWT containing the device identifier in the `sub` field. This JWT can be verified against the JWK set at https://api.trusona.net/jwks to verify its authenticity.
2. Invoke the Trusona API passing in a reference to a context and your implementation of `DeviceIdentifierRequester`.


> **NOTE** Do not store and reuse your device identifier, as it is subject to change. Always call the
`getDeviceIdentifier` method whenever you need the most current device identifier.


### Scanning TruCodes

TruCodes are a mechanism used to identify the user that is attempting to log into a resource protected by trusona.

The Trusona SDk provides a Scanner that will recognize TruCodes and create a Trusonafication whenever one of them is
scanned.

The following example illustrates how to use the TruCode Scanner:

```java
// 1
TruCodeHandler truCodeHandler = new TruCodeHandler() {
  @Override
  public void onTruCode(boolean success) {
    if (success) {
      // The TruCode was successfully scanned. You may want to start monitoring for pending
      // trusonafications at this point if you haven't done so yet.
    }
    else {
      // There was an error while scanning the TruCode
    }
  }

  @NonNull
  @Override
  public Integer fragmentContainerId() {
    // Update this method to return the id of the ViewGroup container into which the Trusona
    // SDK will display the TruCode Scanner. This ID must be present in the layout of the fragment
    // that's in the foreground.
    // i.e.: R.id.my_fragment_container.
    return null;
  }
};

// 2
IdentifierProvider identifierProvider = new IdentifierProvider() {
  @Override
  public String identifier() {
    // Return your device's identifier
    return null;
  }
};

// 3
trusona.loadTruCodeAsChildFragment(myFragment, truCodeHandler, identifierProvider);
```

1. Implement the `TruCodeHandler` interface, which will be notified when the Trucode has been scanned.
2. Implement the `IdentifierProvider` to return the device's identifier
3. Invoke the Trusona API passing in the implemented interfaces and a reference to the `Fragment` where 
the TruCode Scanner should be displayed. This API call should be done once the `Fragment` passed as a parameter
has been attached to its corresponging activity and is visible, for example, during it's `onViewCreated` method.

Alternatively, if you'd like to load the TruCode scanner in a layout that is not part of a `Fragment`, the 
`getTruCodeFragment` method provides a `Fragment` reference that can be loaded using an Activity's 
`SupportFragmentManager`.

### Monitoring for an IN_PROGRESS Trusonafication

A Trusonafication occurs when a user attempts to access a protected resource, and the user is allowed
to accept or deny the action. When a Trusonafication is received, the app needs to respond to confirm
the user's identity. Depending on how the Trusonafication was created, this may involve a visual prompt
requiring the user to accept and/or provide the credentials used to unlock the device.

Monitoring for in progress trusonafications requires an implementation of `TrusonaficationHandler`.

The interface has six methods:
   - `void onAccept(boolean)`
   - `void onReject(boolean)`
   - `void onFailedDependency()`
   - `Integer fragmentContainerId()`
   - `Future<Fragment> prepare(Trusonafication trusonafication)`
   - `Integer acceptRejectLayoutId()`
   
   
#### Example

```java
// 1
TrusonaficationHandler trusonaficationHandler = new TrusonaficationHandler() {
    @Override
    public void onAccept(boolean success) {
        if(success) {
            // trusonafication was successfully accepted and validated
        }
        else {
            // the user intent was to accept it; but the request failed
        }
    }
    
    @OVerride
    public void onReject(boolean success) {
        if(success) {
            // the user's intent to reject the trusonafication was completed successfully
        }
        else {
            // the user's intent to reject the trusonafication failed
        }
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Integer fragmentContainerId() {
        // Update this method to return the id of the ViewGroup container into which the Trusona 
        // SDK will display an identity document scanner if a Trusonafication requires it. This ID must 
        // be present in the layout of the fragment returned by the `prepare` method implementation in
        // this class.
        // i.e.: R.id.my_fragment_container.
        return 0;
    }

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Integer acceptRejectLayoutId() {
        // In order to customize the UI used to prompt users to accept or reject 
        // trusonafications you can return the ID of the xml layout you'd like to use. 
        // Otherwise, return null to use the default OS alert dialog. 
        // i.e.: R.layout.my_accept_reject_layout.
        return 0; // or null
    }

    @Override
    void onFailedDependency() {
        // Update this method to handle the case of when a required dependency to process
        // an IN_PROGRESS trusonafication fails, for instance if the trusonafication is EX but
        // the user is not at level EX yet.
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    Future<Fragment> prepare(Trusonafication trusonafication) {
        // Update this method to return an implementation of Future that returns the Fragment
        // that will be used to host the identity document scanner in case one needs to be shown.
        // The Fragment should be returned by Future.get() only after it has been brought into the
        // foreground and is ready to host the identity document scanner.
        // The provided trusonafication parameter is the IN_PROGRESS trusonafication that we are
        // about to process and can be peeked at to glean information about it.
    }
};

// 2
trusona.monitorForPendingTrusonafication(trusonaficationHandler);

// 3
trusona.stopPendingTrusonaficationsMonitor();
```

1. Implement the `TrusonaficationHandler` interface. The layout whose id is returned by the `acceptRejectLayoutId()`
method can be styled in any way but it must contain the following views to be properly rendered:
* A TextView with the id `trusonafication_phrase`
* A View with the id `trusonafication_accept_button`
* A view with the id `trusonafication_reject_button`

2. Using a previously instantiated `Trusona` object, call `monitorForPendingTrusonafication`, passing 
an instance of the implemented `TrusonaficationHandler` to monitor for a pending `Trusonafication`.

3. To release resources, call `stopPendingTrusonaficationsMonitor` in your `onStop` fragment life cycle method.


### Scanning Driver's Licenses

The Trusona SDK provides a user interface that can be shown to prompt the user to scan the barcode on a US/Canadian driver's license. The SDK will call a callback in the app upon successful scanning and provide the parsed contents of the barcode. In the case of failure, another callback will be called, which should handle the failure in a way that makes sense in the app.

Note: Scanning a driver's license as part of accepting a Trusonafication is handled automatically by the SDK. Use the following method only if you require to examine the contents
of a driver's license as part of the business logic in your application.

```java
// 1
PDF417ScanHandler pdf417ScanHandler = new PDF417ScanHandler() {
	
    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@NonNull DriversLicenseScanResult result) {
    	// examine license properties as necessary
    	AAMVADriversLicense license = result.getDriversLicense();
    	
    	// examine scanning event's metadata. This metadata is subject to change. Additionally, 
    	// all properties may not be available for all scan results.
	// Current available properties are:
	// x - result of division of the x/y point of the top left corner
	// y - result of division of the x/y point of the top right corner
	// h - result of division of the x/y point of the bottom left corner
	// w - result of division of the x/y point of the bottom right corner
	// t - value returned by System.nanoTime()
	//
    	Map<String, ?> metadata = result.getMetadata();    
    }
	
    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Integer fragmentContainerId() {
        // Return the ID of the ViewGroup in which the SDK will attempt to load the Driver
        // License scanner. This ID must be present in the layout of the Fragment that's passed
        // in as a parameter to the scanDriversLicense method, and the Fragment must have been
        // brought into the foreground and be ready to host the Driver License scanner.
        // i.e.: R.id.my_fragment_container.
        return 0;
    }
	
    @Override
    public void onDocumentError(Throwable throwable) {
    	// handle error case due to invalid document being scanned
    }
};

// 2
trusona.scanDriversLicense(fragment, pdf417ScanHandler);
```

1. Implement the `PDF417ScanHandler` interface.
2. Using a previously instantiated `Trusona` object, call `scanDriversLicense`, passing a reference of the fragment into which the Driver License scanner will be inflated and the instance of the implemented `PDF417ScanHandler`.


### Scanning Passports

The Trusona SDK provides a user interface that can be shown to prompt the user to scan the MRZ data on a passport. The SDK will call a callback in the app upon successful scanning and provide the parsed contents of the passport. In the case of failure, another callback will be called, which should handle the failure in a way that makes sense in the app. 

```java
// 1
PassportScanHandler passportScanHandler = new PassportScanHandler() {
    
    @Override
    public void passportScanned(PassportScanResult passportScanResult) {
        // examine license properties as necessary
        Passport passport = passportScanResult.getPassport();
        // examine metadata properties as necessary
        Map<String, Object> metadata = passportScanResult.getMetadata();
    }

    @Override
    public void passportScanCanceled() {
        // Handle what happens when the user taps the Cancel button.
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Integer fragmentContainerId() {
        // Return the ID of the ViewGroup in which the SDK will attempt to load the Passport
        // scanner. This ID must be present in the layout of the Activity that's passed
        // in as a parameter to the getPassportScanner method, and the Activity must have been
        // brought into the foreground and be ready to host the Passport scanner.
        // i.e.: R.id.my_passport_scanner_container.
        return 0;
    }
};

// 2
trusona.getPassportScanner(activity, passportScanHandler);
```

1. Implement the `PassportScanHandler` interface.
2. Using a previously instantiated `Trusona` object, call `getPassportScanner`, passing a reference of the activity into which the Passport scanner will be inflated and the instance of the implemented `PassportScanHandler`.

### Upgrading to Executive

Users can be authenticated at the Executive level if they register a driver's license with their account. Before a user can be authenticated with Executive, they must associate a driver's license. The SDK provides a callback interface to perform this step. 

Before doing the upgrade, it is important to make sure the device identifier of the running app has been bound to an account.

The following code snippet illustrates the required step:

```java
    
// 1    
PDF417UpgradeHandler pdf417UpgradeHandler = new PDF417UpgradeHandler() {

    @Override
    public void onSuccess(@NonNull IdentityDocument<DriversLicenseScanResult> identityDocument) {
    	// examine returned Identity document instance as necessary
    	// Additionally, the user was succesfully upgraded, now you 
    	// can authenticate them at Executive level
      //
      // Additionally, you can examine the scan result for this event with the following method
      DriversLicenseScanResult driversLicenseScanResult = identityDocument.getDocument();
    }

    @NonNull
    @Override
    public Integer fragmentContainerId() {
   	    // Return the ID of the ViewGroup in which the SDK will attempt to load the Driver
        // License scanner. This ID must be present in the layout of the Fragment that's passed
        // in as a parameter to the upgradeToExecutive method, and the Fragment must have been
        // brought into the foreground and ready to host the Driver License scanner.
        // i.e.: R.id.my_fragment_container.
   	     return 0;
    }

    @Override
    public void onDocumentError(Throwable throwable) {
    	// handle error case due to invalid document being scanned
    }
};

// 2
trusona.upgradeToExecutive(fragment, pdf417RegisterHandler);
```

1. Implement the `PDF417UpgradeHandler` interface.
2. Using a previously instantiated `Trusona` object, call `upgradeToExecutive`, passing a reference of the fragment into which the Driver License scanner will be inflated and the instance of the implemented `PDF417RegisterHandler`.

### Customizing the UI
During the Trusonafication process, the user will be presented with several steps of confirmation, depending on the level of verification requested in the Trusonafication. These steps may include:

- A visual prompt that gives the user the choice of accepting or rejecting the Trusonafication
- An operating system authentication (e.g. Fingerprint, Pattern, PIN)
- Scanning of driver's license

The prompt and scanning screens can be customized by setting the `TrusonaficationHandler` property on the `Trusona` class to
an instance of `TrusonaficationHandler` and having the implemented methods of this interface return the appropriate layout id.

### Handling Deep links

Your mobile application needs to be configured to handle deep links so that it can receive the data passed by the Trusona web SDKs
to the Trusona mobile SDKs. Depending on your minimum supported Android version, this may mean you'll need to configure App links and
intent filters for incoming links as well. For more information on how to do this, take a look at the official Android Developers documentation [here](https://developer.android.com/studio/write/app-link-indexing.html) and [here](https://developer.android.com/training/app-links/deep-linking.html).

When deeplinking, Trusona will redirect users to your application using this url:

`<scheme>://<handle>.applaunchexpress.com/trucode?payload=XXXXXXXXXXXXXXXX`

The `scheme` will depend on whether you are using App links or a custom scheme. The former will use `https` and the later a
scheme of your choice. The `handle` will be provided by Trusona and is unique to your application.

Once one of your Activities has been set up to handle deep links, it will need to implement the following steps:

```java

//1 
TruCodeHandler deepLinkTruCodeHandler = new TruCodeHandler() {

    @Override
    public void onTruCode(boolean success) {
        if(success) {
            // the deeplink trusonafication was successfully accepted and validated.
        }
        else {
            // There was an error while processing the deeplink trusonafication.
        }
    }

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Integer fragmentContainerId() {
        // Update this method to return the id of the ViewGroup container in which the accept / reject 
        // prompt will be loaded. This ID must be present in the layout of the fragment passed to the `handleTruCodeDeepLink`
        // method.
        return null;
    }

    @Nullable
    @Override
    public Integer acceptRejectLayoutId() {
        // Update this method to return the id of the layout that will be used to prompt users
        // to accept or reject trusonafications. Alternatively, return null to use the default OS 
        // alert dialog.
        return null;
    }
};

// 2
@Override
protected void onCreate(Bundle bundle) {
    super.onCreate(bundle);
    // Your code goes here

    // 2.1 Load the fragment that will host the accept / reject prompt.

    // 2.2
    trusona.handleTruCodeDeepLink(fragment, deepLinkTruCodeHandler, getIntent().getData());
}

@Override
protected void onStop() {
    super.onStop();
    // Your code goes here
    // 3
    trusona.stopPendingTrusonaficationsMonitor();
}


```

1. Provide an implementation of the `TruCodeHandler` interface.
2. Update your activity's `onCreate` method to:
  * Load the fragment that will host the accept / reject prompt.
  * Use an existing instance of the Trusona class to call `handleTruCodeDeepLink` passing in a reference to the fragment loaded in the previous step, the `TruCodeHandler` implementation from step 1, and the deep link payload acquired by calling `getIntent().getData()`.
3. Update your activity's `onStop` method to call `stopPendingTrusonaficationsMonitor`.
