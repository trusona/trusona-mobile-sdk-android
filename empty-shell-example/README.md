### An Empty Example

Bare application; that does nothing except ensure the Trusona SDK dependency compiles against the supported Android baseline.

You may use this as a starting point for any applications depending on the Trusona SDK.


#### Building

On your terminal, from this directory, simply run:

```bash
./gradlew build
```

On success, the (debug) APK will be found at `./app/build/outputs/apk/debug/app-debug.apk`
